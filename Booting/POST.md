### POST

One of the first tasks performed by the firmware when a computer turns on is the "Power On Self Test" (POST), which tests the functionality of essential components.

This often produces a series of beeps, which can be used to diagnose problems (one beep is usually success). If there is a problem in the POST, the system will shutdown (and possibly reboot).

> Here are some common reasons POST might fail:
>
> - No CPU, or incompatible CPU
> - No RAM, or RAM in wrong slots
> - Damaged components, or faulty connections
> - Overheating (CPU fan missing, etc)
