# Boot Manager / Setup Utility

The Boot Manager is the first user interface and opportunity for user interaction with the computer. The Boot Manager is typically skipped, so that the bootloader can begin as soon as possible, but it can be accessed by pressing the right key (often `DEL`, `ESC` or `F1`-`F12`).

The Boot Manager differs depending on the motherboard, but is where one can choose which drive to boot from, and which mode to boot them in. Additional options are frequently supported, such as system time, fan speeds, overclocking, and other advanced functionality.
